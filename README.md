# 5-Stage Pipelined RISC Processor (VHDL)

Designed and implemented a **5-stage pipelined RISC processor** in **VHDL**, simulated and tested using **ModelSim**.

## Features
- ✅ Supports **32 different instructions** across three instruction formats (**R, I, J**)
- ✅ Implements **full forwarding** to reduce pipeline stalls
- ✅ Includes a **branch predictor** for improved execution efficiency
- ✅ Integrates a **hazard detection unit** to manage pipeline conflicts
- ✅ Features an **exception handler** for robust error management

## Technologies Used
- **VHDL** – for hardware description and design
- **ModelSim** – for simulation and verification
